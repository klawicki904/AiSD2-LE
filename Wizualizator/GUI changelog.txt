Changelog 09.04.2025:
Created basic graph system, allowing to add nodes, arrows and change their data.

Changelog 16.04.2025 (v0.3):
The graph area has been re-made in world space instead of UI, allowing for easier positioning and near-endless space.

Changelog 23.04.2025 (v0.4):
Added Input to Graph conversion system. Arrows are now random-colored. The UI now scales properly, matching any screen size.

Changelog 07.05.2025 (v0.5):
- mouse scroll wheel button (middle mouse button) now moves the graph view
- Files with graph data can be opened in standalone builds and converted to a graph
- Remade the file<=>graph conversion system; both input fields and the graph automatically synchronize
- added a loading screen while clearing and generating a graph, only camera movement is allowed while graph is loading
- clearing or generating a graph no longer freezes the program
- graph generation can be cancelled
- added special actions menu in the graph tab: 
	• clearing the graph, 
	• moving to world's center position (X = 0, Y = 0)
	• show entire graph - adjusts the camera to contain all the nodes in its view, regardless of the max zoom setting
- nodes can be selected by dragging in a rectangle area
- arrows' values can be updated at any time, automatic flow updates can be disabled in settings

Changelog 21.05.2025 (v0.6):
- fixed a bug where cancelling graph generation while it's deleting nodes prevents next generating attempts
- program no longer freezes when switching tabs while a huge graph is loaded
- added quarters' visualisation support, added a special action button to toggle adding border points" mode; quarters' edges change color to red when not convex or overlap other quarters
- added breweries conversion rate support to special actions
- updated input and output files to support quarters and conversion rate
- if two or more nodes are in the exact same position, they become red;
- added a confirmation menu before saving a graph with incorrect input (red nodes or quarters)
- added "Graph Elements Size" slider
- added tooltips for buttons in the File tab and in the Special Actions menu
- added a confirmation screen before saving a file containing incorrectly placed elements
- left-clicking UI elements no longer interacts with the graph at the same time
- UI aesthetic improvements
- field nodes now display their yield above the node, breweries display their capacity
- added output file (file with problem solution) visualization in the "Simulate" tab; the Simulate tab is not empty anymore
- added undo and redo features (holding CTRL-Z or CTRL-Y repeats the actions)
- arrows now show an outline when selected or in a simulation step
- nodes become transparent while overlapping other nodes
- arrows now change color depending on the node type they start from; the color types can be changed in the settings

Changelog 04.06.2025 (v0.7)
- fixed simulation visualizer updating nodes' values incorrectly
- added quarter support for simulation visualizer
- fields outside quarters are red (not allowed)
- added Polish language option
- settings are saved upon exiting and loaded on startup (file: settings.conf)
-
